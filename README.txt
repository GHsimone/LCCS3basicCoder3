LCCS3 is the last version of the <b>Land Cover Classification System (LCCS)</b> developed by FAO and UNEP in 1998 to facilitate the understanding of the classes of land cover regardless of the scale of mapping, the type of coverage, method of data collection, or geographic location.

LCCS3 is an implementation of <b>Land Cover Meta Language (LCML)</b>, become a standard ISO in 2012 with the identification 19144-2:2012. The LCML provides a common reference structure for the comparison and integration of data for any generic land cover classification system, and describes different land cover classification systems based on the physiognomic aspects.
